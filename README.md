## Hi there I'm Matúš Tinák 👋

I’m a minimalist by choice and a Linux enthusiast by necessity.

🐧 About Me

🎓 Education: Pursuing a degree in Digital Technologies at STU Bratislava.

❤️ Passions: Deeply interested in Linux and the Open Source philosophy.

⚡ Goal: Diving into C to master the tools I rely on daily.

🌱 Philosophy: I believe software should be simple, incredibly fast, and stay out of the user's way.

📂 Featured Project: The Suckless Environment

This is my main "Daily Driver." It isn't just a window manager; it's a hand-crafted ecosystem I built to fit my exact workflow.

🛠️ Built in C: Every component (dwm, st, dwmblocks) is patched and compiled from source.

🚀 Future Projects: The Home Lab

I just bought a Minisforum MS-01 Workstation, and I'm currently planning my home server architecture.

🏗️ Target: Proxmox virtualization, self-hosted services, and automated network storage.

“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”
