## Hi there I'm Matúš Tinák 👋

I am a university student at STU in Bratislava, studying Digital Technologies. I’m a minimalist by choice and a Linux enthusiast by necessity.

🐧 About Me

Education: Pursuing a degree in Digital Technologies at STU Bratislava.

Passions: Deeply interested in Linux and the Open Source philosophy.

Current Focus: Optimizing my Suckless environment—mostly so I can enjoy a system that actually respects my hardware.

Goal: Diving into C to master the low-level architecture of the tools I rely on daily.

Philosophy: I believe software should be simple, incredibly fast, and stay out of the user's way.

Featured Project: The Suckless Environment

This is my main "Daily Driver." It isn't just a window manager; it's a hand-crafted ecosystem I built to fit my exact workflow.

Built in C: Every component (dwm, st, dwmblocks) is patched and compiled from source.

Automated Aesthetics: Custom shell logic to sync system-wide themes with my wallpapers.

🚀 Future Projects: The Home Lab

I just bought a Minisforum MS-01 Workstation, and I'm currently planning my home server architecture.

Target: Proxmox virtualization, self-hosted services, and automated network storage.

Focus: Applying the same "Suckless" minimalist philosophy to server-side infrastructure.

🛠️ Tech Stack

OS: Arch Linux (Suckless/dwm)

Languages: Shell (Bash/Zsh), currently learning C

Hardware: Minisforum MS-01, Custom Laptop build

“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”
